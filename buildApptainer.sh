# This script is a helper script for building Apptainer image files as a batch
# job in slurm. The script has one mandatory argument, and another optional arg,
# invoked like so:
                                                                             
# `buildApptainer.sh defFileName (sandbox)`
                                                                             
# The `defFileName` argument is mandatory, and is the name of the apptainer
# definition (.def) file, which will also be the name of the .sif file output by
# the build process.
                                                                             
# The `sandbox` argument is optional, and defines whether or not to create a
# sandbox image. Building a sandbox image takes much longer, and results in a
# folder rather than an image file. In theory, this can be used to execute the
# container with a writable file system, but I haven't had success with that.
# The default is to not build a sandbox image.
                                                                             
# When running this script as a batch process via slurm (recommended in HUIT
# OOD), it can be invoked like so:
                                                                             
# `sbatch -c 8 buildApptainer.sh defFileName (sandbox)`
                                                                             
# This runs the script with 8 CPUs and the arguments provided.
